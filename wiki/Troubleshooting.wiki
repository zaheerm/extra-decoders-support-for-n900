#summary Troubleshooting the installation

= Troubleshooting =

Installation may take a while. Be patient. If Media Player goes empty after installation you may need to restart your device. Then you have to wait a while for indexing, but if all this fails, then you may have to reset Tracker by issuing the "tracker-processes -r" command in X Terminal as a normal user (NOT as root, without the quotation marks). Remember that re-indexing your media from scratch may take a very long time, depending on how large your collection is. Be patient. You can check the status of Tracker in X Terminal by issuing the "tracker-status" command as a normal user (NOT as root, without the quotation marks). "Indexing" means you have to wait, "Paused" means that indexing is done. If it's "Stopped" or any other status, then you may need to restart your device.
