Installation may take a while. Be patient. If Media Player goes empty after installation you may need to restart your device. Then you have to wait a while for indexing, but if all this fails, then you may have to reset Tracker by issuing the "tracker-processes -r" command in X Terminal as a normal user (NOT as root, without the quotation marks). Remember that re-indexing your media from scratch may take a very long time, depending on how large your collection is. Be patient. You can check the status of Tracker in X Terminal by issuing the "tracker-status" command as a normal user (NOT as root, without the quotation marks). "Indexing" means you have to wait, "Paused" means that indexing is done. If it's "Stopped" or any other status, then you may need to restart your device.

= Re-installing from X Terminal =

You can try this if Tracker times out during installation (you'll notice this when your device becomes sluggish and the Media Player is empty). This is a method of RE-installing from the X Terminal. It is not dangerous in any way if you follow the commands to the letter. 

First, install the rootsh package from the Application Manager.

Then, open the X Terminal and execute these commands:

sudo gainroot

We now have admin rights. Be careful.

This is one long command:

apt-get purge gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-flv gstreamer0.10-musepack gstreamer0.10-rm gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad-extra ogg-support

When asked, choose "Y" (yes) and hit Enter. We have removed a long list of additional decoders and meta-packages.

apt-get clean

You can stop here if you want a pristine device, without any multimedia add-ons.

apt-get update

This updates the list of available packages to make sure we're getting the latest ones.

apt-get install decoders-support

This will install Extra Decoders Support once more. You can track the progress in the X Terminal. Once it's done you can close the X Terminal.
