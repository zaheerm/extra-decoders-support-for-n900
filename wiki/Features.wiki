= Introduction =

The purpose of the project is to get some specific missing multimedia formats indexed and supported by the built-in Media Player. There is also support for seamless playback of most supported formats from the File Manager. 

= Features =

Currently supported formats (0.4):

 * AC-3 audio in video files (indexed)
 * Vorbis OGG (indexed)
 * FLAC (not indexed, waiting for ogg-support 1.0.6, seeking not supported)
 * Theora (presumably indexed)
 * Musepack (indexed, seeking works, but might fail)
 * FLV container (indexed, some formats used with this container may not be supported)
 * Real Media formats (may not be indexed, but seamless playback from built-in File Manager, seeking works, but might fail)
 * Matroska container (indexed, some formats used with this container may not be supported )
 * MPEG2 Transport Stream (mostly untested, works only for some people) 
 * WebM



= What Happens Under The Hood =

Tracker is used to register new formats and index them for the Media Player. Standard freedesktop-compliant XML file with mimetypes and a .desktop file are used for seamless playback from the built-in File Manager. GStreamer plugins from custom packages are used, installed and registered for use by the built-in Media Player.
