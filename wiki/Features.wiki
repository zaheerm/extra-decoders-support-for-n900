= Introduction =

The purpose of the project is to get some specific missing multimedia formats indexed and supported by the built-in Media Player.

= Features =

Currently supported formats (0.3.4-1):

 * AC-3 audio in video files (indexed)
 * Vorbis OGG (indexed)
 * FLAC (not indexed, waiting for ogg-support 1.0.6, *seeking unsupported*)
 * Theora (presumably indexed)
 * Musepack (indexed, *seeking unsupported*)
 * Flash Video (indexed)
 * Real Media formats (not indexed, seamless playback from built-in File Manager, seeking might fail)
 * Matroska container (indexed, *most formats used for MKV files unsupported*)
 * MPEG2 Transport Stream (mostly untested, works only for some people) 

Support for seamless playback of most supported formats from the File Manager. 

= What Happens Under The Hood =

Tracker is used to register new formats and index them for the Media Player. Standard freedesktop-compliant XML file with mimetypes and a .desktop file are used for seamless playback from the built-in File Manager. GStreamer plugins are used from separate packages, installed and registered for use by the built-in Media Player.

The project uses its own custom built packages with Real Media and Musepack plugins, other plugins are taken from packages provided already by other members of the Maemo community.
